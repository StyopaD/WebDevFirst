# PersonalPracticeProjects
Every personal project to practice, you know!
First Session covers the VERY basics with some stupid explanations and a really simple final design of a Bakery WebPage. Following the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQWlgd7hV4A
Second Session covers a bit more interesting Web following the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gNrZ4lAnAw
The third session is another webpage, a bit more complex, albeit not too much, following the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-h8L5hgW-w&list=PLpyY081wcdfxJsUsPNZ_Cz4O1ARAp_eDd&index=45&t=115s
The Fourth session is yet another webpage, this time without any tutorials, but just an image from the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh6KtCKRP8U&t=324s first entry!
The Fith session follows the tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xNcXwC6ikQ to create a neon button and the 3D animations/transformations that are involved into its creation as well.
The sixth session follows the tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBw9-K6hYVA to create a light saber, it looks way more complicated than it really is, just tedious work...
